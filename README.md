## Running the example

In this repository have tow examples: 
- [HelloWorld](src/main/java/com/ontotext/graphdb/example/app/hello/HelloWorld.java)
- [FamilyRelationsApp](src/main/java/com/ontotext/graphdb/example/app/family/FamilyRelationsApp.java)

> To run any of these examples, run the main method.

These examples use an embedded database, but you can replace it with a remote one. To do this you need to download and install some version of GraphDB (Docker, desktop etc), to download this go to [graphdb site](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/).
